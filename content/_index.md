Hi! I'm Claire. I am a PhD candidate in NLP at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by [Michael Rovatsos](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/prof-michael-rovatsos) and [Nehal Bhuta](https://www.law.ed.ac.uk/people/professor-nehal-bhuta) and a Bloomberg PhD Fellow. As part of EdinburghNLP, I have an ongoing collaboration with [Pasquale Minervini](http://www.neuralnoise.com/). I am also affiliated with the [Centre for Technomoral Futures](https://www.technomoralfutures.uk/). I am interested in topics in information extraction, indirectly supervised learning, domain-specific language models and fairness for NLP. During my PhD project, I am working on advancing legal information extraction with a specific focus on designing and implementing NLP-based functionalities in the legal workflow to inform, speed up and improve the transparency of the refugee claim process. 

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a financial analyst and studied at Paris Dauphine University. I have a background in economics and finance, and graduated with a masters of research in computer science in 2021 with a project on generating fairness through explanations in decision making.
