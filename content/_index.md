Hi! I'm Claire. I am a PhD candidate in NLP at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by [Michael Rovatsos](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/prof-michael-rovatsos) and [Nehal Bhuta](https://www.law.ed.ac.uk/people/professor-nehal-bhuta). As part of the Bloomberg PhD Fellowship received last year, I am currently interning at Bloomberg NYC, supervised by Leslie Barrett, and working on temporal event extraction. I am also affiliated with the [Centre for Technomoral Futures](https://www.technomoralfutures.uk/). I am interested in information extraction, indirectly supervised learning, domain-specific language models and fairness for NLP. During my Ph.D. project, I am working on advancing legal information extraction with a specific focus on designing and implementing NLP-based functionalities in the legal workflow to inform, speed up, and improve the transparency of the refugee claim process. 

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a financial analyst and studied at Paris Dauphine University. I have a background in economics and finance and graduated with a master's of research in computer science in 2021.
